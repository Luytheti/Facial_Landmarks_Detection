## Introduction
Facial landmark detection is a crucial step in many computer vision applications such as face recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality. This project aims to develop an efficient facial landmark detection system using the Xception model, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture that excels in image classification tasks. 

## Model Architecture
### Xception Model
The Xception model is an extension of the Inception architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to enhance model efficiency and performance. This model has been trained on a diverse dataset, making it suitable for detecting facial landmarks with high accuracy.

## Dataset
### iBUG Dataset
This project utilizes the iBUG dataset, which provides a variety of annotated facial images. The dataset is widely used in the research community for benchmarking facial landmark detection algorithms. It contains images of various individuals with different facial expressions, orientations, and lighting conditions, making it ideal for training robust models.
